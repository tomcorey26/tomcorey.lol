      <h1>ðŸ‘Š Welcome, Bruther</h1>
      <p>
        Hey I'm Tom, a software engineer from Rhode Island. My expertise is in
        web development with <strong>React, Vue, TypeScript, and Node.js</strong
        >. I enjoy working with a variety of technologies and learning new
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to long ago, I was working as a full stack software engineer at
        <a href="https://starry.com/" target="_blank">Starry</a>, a Boston-based
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider"
          target="_blank">internet service provider</a
        >. I was responsible for adding features to our <a
          href="https://order.starry.com/signup/59b811777bf2fb0a9213c3d9"
          target="_blank">sign up flow</a
        >, maintaining out our internal admin dashboard, and building out a <a
          href="https://account.starry.com/login"
          target="_blank"
        >
          new customer portal.
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, Starry started to struggle financially and was forced to
        lay off 50% their staff, including myself.
        <strong>
          I'm currently looking for a new job, so if you're hiring,
