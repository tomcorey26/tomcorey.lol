It's time to ditch the idea that setting goals is the be-all and end-all of success. Sure, goals can be a good starting point, but it's the systems we put in place to reach those goals that are the real driving force behind our success.

Take, for example, the goal of "getting in shape." If that's your goal, simply setting it and hoping for the best isn't going to cut it. You need to lay out the exact steps you'll take each day to make progress towards that goal. And let's be real - getting fit isn't something that happens overnight. It's the result of consistently repeating certain habits over a long period of time. You ever see someone go to the gym once and then look like they're ready to take on the Mr. Universe competition the next day? Didn't think so.

It's not just about the end result - it's about the journey to get there. By developing systems, we can create a framework that allows for flexibility and adaptability, rather than being tied to a specific outcome. Systems give us a sense of control over our progress and create momentum to help us achieve our goals faster and more efficiently. Plus, unlike goals that have a time limit, systems can be constantly evaluated and refined for continuous improvement. This means that even after we reach our initial goals, we can continue to make progress and strive for even greater success.

So let's stop relying on goals alone and start focusing on developing systems that will help us reach them. It may require a shift in mindset, but in the end it will lead to long-term success and satisfaction.
