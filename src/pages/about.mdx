Hi I'm Tom. I live in Providence Rhode Island. I'm a software engineer specializing in web development, with a focus on JavaScript related technologies.
I love working on and building tools that help people learn new skills. I created [**Speech Islands**](https://www.speechislands.com/), an AI-powered language learning platform that helps people become conversational faster and for cheap. The platform leverages advanced AI to provide personalized practice sessions and real-time feedback, making language learning more accessible and effective than traditional methods.

In my free time I enjoy staying active with yoga, rock climbing and running. I also enjoy practicing spanish and cooking.

I'm excited to use my skills and knowledge to help build and maintain websites that are efficient, user-friendly, and visually appealing. If you have a project in mind or are looking for a web developer, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
