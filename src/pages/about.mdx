Hi I'm Tom. I live in Providence Rhode Island. I'm a software engineer specializing in web development, with a focus on JavaScript related technologies.
I love working on and building tools that help people learn new skills. Currently Working on _Language Islands_ a language learning platform that uses AI and memory techniques to help you learn a new language.

In my free time I enjoy staying active with yoga, rock climbing and running. I also enjoy practicing spanish and cooking (Just started going vegetarian!).

I'm excited to use my skills and knowledge to help build and maintain websites that are efficient, user-friendly, and visually appealing. If you have a project in mind or are looking for a web developer, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
