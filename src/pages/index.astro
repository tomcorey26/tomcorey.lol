        <h1>ðŸ‘Š Welcome, Bruther</h1>
        <p>
          Hey I'm Tom, a software engineer from Rhode Island. My expertise is in
          web development with <strong
            >React, Vue, TypeScript, and Node.js</strong
          >. I enjoy working with a variety of technologies and learning new
          things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to long ago, I was working as a full stack software engineer at
          <a href="https://starry.com/" target="_blank">Starry</a>, a
          Boston-based

            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider"
            target="_blank">internet service provider</a
          >. I was responsible for adding features to our <a
            href="https://order.starry.com/signup/59b811777bf2fb0a9213c3d9"
            target="_blank">sign up flow</a
          >, maintaining our internal admin dashboard, and building out a <a
            href="https://account.starry.com/login"
            target="_blank"
          >
            new customer portal.
          </a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, Starry started to struggle financially and was forced
          to
